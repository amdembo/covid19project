A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first internationally reported from China on 31 December 2019. Today we know this virus as COVID-19, or more casually, as Coronavirus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to "flatten the curve". We have consequently experienced social distancing and many people have passed away as well.

Our goal in this project is to provide an answer to this question: Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?
